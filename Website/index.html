                    <p>
                        My name is Alex Roberts. I'm a sophomore in college studying IT & Cybersecurity. I find a lot of my classes really fun, especially compared to last year. My main goal is to learn as much as I possibly can, and then get a really cool job that suites me. I've lived in a small town called Greenfield all of my life. I like playing piano, video games, bowling, making videos, and repairing electronics. My most recent project was building this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-Complete-Daft-Punk-Helmet-Build-Arduino-Style/">Daft Punk Helmet</a> which you can see <a href=#"daft.html">here</a>.
